    <h1>About GameSpire</h1>
    <p>
      GameSpire is an independent gaming platform focused on delivering accessible and engaging content to players.
    </p>
  <P>We started this site cause of our school. Our admins did their job and took down our google site so we had to improvise. We created a Github Repo not thinking much of it, but as the days went on we started working on it more and more and then it went full fledge into a new game site we like to call GameSpire</P>
